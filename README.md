# Reactor

**Reactor** is a lightweight and experimental WebAssembly runtime, built as a learning project. The primary goal was to compile a "Hello, World!" program in Rust and run it inside my very own runtime (which isn't that simple because the binary contains **alot** of framework code). While Reactor is not designed for performance or real-world use, it serves as a stepping stone to understanding WebAssembly internals.

## What is Reactor?

Reactor is a custom WebAssembly interpreter focused on simplicity and educational exploration. Itâ€™s an ongoing project aimed at gaining hands-on experience with the core concepts of WebAssembly runtimes, without diving into advanced features like JIT. Itâ€™s the perfect environment for anyone who wants to experiment and learn about how WASM and WASI operate under the hood.

## Goals

- ðŸ›  **Learn by Doing**: The main objective is to explore WebAssembly runtime internals by running a simple Rust program.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Rust-First**: The runtime was built with Rust-compiled WebAssembly modules in mind, with the initial target being a "Hello, World!" application.
- ðŸš§ **Ongoing Experimentation**: This project will continue to evolve as more WebAssembly concepts and features are explored.

## Contributing

Since Reactor is a learning project, contributions are welcomed, especially if youâ€™re also interested in understanding WebAssembly and want to tinker along. Feel free to fork, play, and share your findings!
